"""The emulators an EmulationStation system list offers, by system.

AmberELEC writes its list as es_systems.cfg XML, EmuELEC as an es_systems.json
it turns into that XML at build time. Both name, per system and in the order
the menu shows them, the emulators a user may pick and the cores under each.
Some emulators are libretro front ends (RetroArch, retrorun) whose cores are
libretro core names. Every other emulator is a standalone program, named as
the OS's launch code dispatches on it (`HATARISA`, `PPSSPPSDL`): profiles
answer to that spelling in their `cores:`.
