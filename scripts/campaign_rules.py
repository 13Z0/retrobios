"""The campaign's fixed rule table: which verdicts settle which profile field.

Each rule is a pure function of verdicts read from core probe records (the
boot oracle of core_probe.py: boots, bios_error, crash, hang, unknown) and
a profile entry. It returns verdicts on profile fields. One with `apply` set
is settled by the table and written into the profile with the record ids as
`evidence:`. Any other goes to the review queue (measurements/findings.jsonl).

Three runs are compared for a file, all on the same content: `none` with no
BIOS at all, `present` with the file alone, and wrong files staged under its
name (zeros of its size, its first half, another region's dump).

  runs                                          field          settled
  none boots, the file changes the run          hle_fallback   true
  none fails, present boots                     required       true
                                                hle_fallback   false
  zeros refused, present boots                  validation     a content check
  zeros used, present boots                     validation     no content check
  half refused, zeros used                      validation     size
  half used                                     validation     no size check
  opens the staged file under another path      path           that path
  opens the staged file under another name      aliases        name added
  a staged file the content should use, never   -              flagged only
  read
  copies of one file that boot and fail         -              queued

"Fails" is bios_error, crash or hang. A wrong file is refused when the
core reports a BIOS error, or when it boots without the BIOS screens the
right file shows (it fell back to a built-in BIOS). It is used when it
turns the run into a hang or a crash that the run without any file does not
show. Anything else settles nothing. Of validation, the table writes only a
missing `size`. A contradicted content check goes to review: which hash a
core computes is read in its code.

Standard library only.
