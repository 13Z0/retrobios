"""Exporter for BizHawk's FirmwareDatabase.cs.

The database is C#: every firmware is a call whose arguments are the SHA1,
the size, the file name and a description, wired into option lists and
status flags that only the source expresses. Every hash it states is
BizHawk's own and every hash it leaves out is left out on purpose, so the
file is served as BizHawk wrote it, checked for its structure.
