"""Exporter for AmberELEC's batocera-systems.

Batocera's script shape, so only the systems dict is rewritten. Two things
differ. Paths are relative to /storage/roms, where the list also names
neogeo/ beside bios/, and our destinations start there too. No entry carries
an emulator or core gate: coreExists() lets an ungated item through for
every build, and an addition is written the same way.
