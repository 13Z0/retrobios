"""Read a profile's core_version from the source its version_basis records.

A profile states the version of the code it was read at. Copied from a
libretro .info or left behind by a pin advance, it named another release:
snes9x said 1.61 at a pin whose snes9x.h states 1.63, and four bulk advances
moved 295 pins without touching one version. version_basis records where the
version is read, so a tool can read it again at any pin:

- ``file``: a pattern in one file of a declared repository at its pin, the
  version the program states (a macro, a build file, a package file).
- ``tag``: the nearest tag in the pin's history and the commits after it,
  for code that takes its version from git at build time. core_version is
  the tag at distance 0, else ``<tag>-<distance>-g<pin7>``, git describe's
  form.
- ``alias``: the same binary as another profile, whose version it carries.
- ``package``: an artefact read outside any source tree (an Android package,
  a closed binary, a release archive): a version no pin can be asked for.
  A pattern reads it from the artefact's name when the name states it.
- ``none``: the code at the pin states no version and no tag reaches it.
  core_version is then null.
- ``unverified``: no reading could be made (``why``: no pin, a host the
  tools cannot read, a forge gone, no build named as read, no source).
  core_version stays as written and is reported unconfirmed.

A profile whose builds live in different repositories keys version_basis by
build mode, the way it keys core_version.
