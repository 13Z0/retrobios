# Images that need a real device

These pictures show a real screen, so they are captured on a real install and
never drawn as a mock-up. Each entry says what the capture must show, where it
goes, and the alt text it carries. Folder layouts that follow from data are
drawn by `scripts/sitediagrams.py` instead (the MinUI card tree is
`<!-- image: minui-card -->`).

Captures: PNG or WebP, 1200 px wide at most, cropped tight, under 150 KB,
personal paths and user names removed. Menu labels are checked against the
current release of the software before the capture is used. Put each file in
`docs_assets/screens/` and note the software version in the commit message.
